1] Dimension Table:

-- Definition:
        > A dimension table is a table in a database that stores descriptive attributes, often text 
          values, that provide context to the data in a fact table.

-- Example:
        > Consider a sales database. The dimension table could be “Product” with columns like ProductID, 
          ProductName, Category, and Supplier. 
        > Each row represents a unique product and its details.


2] Fact Table:

-- Definition:
        > A fact table is a table in a database that stores quantitative data (facts) about a business 
          process, usually numeric values such as sales revenue, quantity sold, or profit.
        > If dimension tables provide the “who, what, where, and when,” think of the fact table as the 
          “how much.” 
        > It contains measurable data that represents the performance of a business process.

-- Example:
        > In the same sales database, the fact table could be “Sales” with columns like OrderID, 
          ProductID, CustomerID, Date, and SalesAmount. 
        > Each row represents a specific sale and its quantitative details.


-- Let’s consider a scenario where we have two dimension tables, “Product” and “Customer,” and one 
   fact table, “Sales.”

-- Example Tables:

1. Dimension Table — Product:

— — — — — —
| ProductID | ProductName | Category | Supplier |
| — — — — — — | — — — — — — — | — — — — — — -| — — — — — — — — -|
| 1 | Laptop | Electronics | ABC Electronics|
| 2 | Smartphone | Electronics | XYZ Tech |
| 3 | Desk Chair | Furniture | Comfort Furnish |
— — — —

2. Dimension Table — Customer:

— — — — — —
| CustomerID | CustomerName | Region |
| — — — — — — | — — — — — — — — -| — — — — — — |
| 201 | John Doe | North |
| 202 | Jane Smith | South |
| 203 | Robert Johnson | East |
— — — —

3. Fact Table — Sales:

— — — — — —
| OrderID | ProductID | CustomerID | Date | SalesAmount |
| — — — — -| — — — — — -| — — — — — — | — — — — — — | — — — — — — -|
| 101 | 1 | 201 | 2023–01–15 | 1200 |
| 102 | 2 | 202 | 2023–01–16 | 800 |
| 103 | 1 | 203 | 2023–01–16 | 1100 |
| 104 | 3 | 201 | 2023–01–17 | 200 |
— — — —


-- Example Query:

Let’s say we want to find the total sales amount for each product category in the North region. The query would look like this:

— — — —
SELECT p.Category, SUM(s.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
JOIN Customer c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.Region = ‘North’
GROUP BY p.Category;
— — — —

-- Output:

— — — — — —
| Category | TotalSales |
| — — — — — — -| — — — — — — |
| Electronics | 1200 |
| Furniture | 200 |
— — — —
